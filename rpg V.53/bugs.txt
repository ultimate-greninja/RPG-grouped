enemy created 3 times at once
enemy health bar bugging out
weapon inventory page movement not going past page 2
weapon durability not updated
a new enemy is generated every time / old enemy isn't used if not defeated in one blow because of this the attack never happens
general placement of items in weapon inventory not how they should be
attacks have no cool down do to reloading maybe have a cookie that acts as a timer
enemy shared (shouldn't be)
enemy not attacking maybe???
the footer
look of the game
