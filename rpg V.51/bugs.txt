enemy created 3 times at once
enemy health bar bugging out
weapon inventory page movement not going past page 2
weapon durability not updated
data is not got from the database if the cookie doesnt exist (exeption should be user id)
a new enemy is generated every time / old enemy isnt used if not defeated in one blow because of this the attack never happens
general placement of items in weapon inventory not how they should be
attacks have no cool down do to reloading maybe have a cookie that acts as a timer
